Base repository used to create Taqtile's Onboard projects

# Hi there!

First of all, welcome to Taqtile!

To help you become more familiar with our current stack, we are proposing a simple project. 
Regardless of the technology you'll be using, the project remains the same with a few modifications.

# Onboard project

The onboard project consists of 4 major features:

- login
- user list
- the detail of an user
- adding a new user

We created some **issues** in this project to guide and help you to get all this features done.

So... let's get started!
